**Data Assignment**
-------------------

For this assignment I used _**SQLite to analyze**_ and explore the data and used _**Tableau for some visualizations.**_ I have written comments and my analyses and thought process for each question to the best of my ability.

I have structured the responses for the questions as follows

1.  [Data Quality](https://github.com/aditi-hudli/Data-Assignment/tree/main/Data Exploration) - I wrote down some observations about the data quality in a document
    
2.  [Close Ended Questions](https://github.com/aditi-hudli/Data-Assignment/tree/main/Close Ended Questions) - The answer to each question has a separate document
    
3.  [Open Ended Questions](https://github.com/aditi-hudli/Data-Assignment/tree/main/Open Ended Questions) - I have attempted 2 of these questions each has a separate document with my analysis and some code snippets
    
4.  [Message](https://github.com/aditi-hudli/Data-Assignment/blob/main/Slack Message.docx) - I wrote out a message to a senior colleague
    
5.  Readme
    
6.  Data sources provided to me.
    

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Aditi
